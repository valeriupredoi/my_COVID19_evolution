## My COVID19 evolution, described day-by-day

### Day 1: Thursday 27 April 2023

- entire day as per normal
- around 1130pm situation escalates abruptly: from feeling absolutely fine to shivering and feeling
  very cold (in a warm room) within minutes;
- half an hour later muscular pain
- a few hours into the night, intestinal cramps and violent stool, akin a bout of food poisoning
- shivers and muscular pain continues all through the night

### Day 2: Friday 28 April 2023

- general tiredness (severe), muscular pain, intestinal gas, severe headache (left frontal and back of the head)
- high temperature
- no apptetite, a mild cough
- only thing I could do was sleep, very poor sleep, waking up every 15-30min
- could not eat anything the whole day
- very thirsty
- this condition did not change over 24 hours

### Day 3: Saturday 29 April 2023

- had to travel from Vienna back to Reading
- temperature felt lower
- still very tired, no appetite, headache milder now, muscular pain lower
- stomach not feeling right still (morning coffee almost immediately pooped out), only food I had was a pretzel towards the middle of the day
- smell and taste quite normal
- still very thirsty
- cough more prominent, not a dry cough, but rather, bringing out flem

### Day 4: Sunday 30 April 2023

**Positive COVID-19 test**: very pronounced two lines; test solution in test tube turned almost milky white

- slept a lot the previous night: very bad sleep, with a lot of convoluted dreams
- temperature felt higher than the previous day
- even more tired than the previous day, still no appetite at all, muscular pain back to mid-high levels
- wet cough and sour throat
- headache but very mild
- wet stool, uncontrolable
- smell and taste starting to diminish
- not thirsty any longer
- bizzarrely very low morale, and anger fits
- managed solid food around 4pm - which immediately put an end to the intestinal unrest
- not sleepy, but needing to lie down

### Day 5: Monday 1 May 2023

- managed to sleep for 12 hours, much better a sleep than the previous night
- tempereture feels at its lowest

- no more headache
- dry cough when talking, throat almost not at all sour anymore
- smell and taste at a low
- much better morale, no more anger fits
- took propolis
- towards the middle of the day: an interesting pain-free feeling, almost as if I was high
- good stamina in the evening, had two full meals for the first time since last Thursday
